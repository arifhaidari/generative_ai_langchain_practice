## Project Overview

### Inception Phase

- **PDF Question Answering Tool**:

  - **Description**: Feed PDF documents into the system and ask questions about the content. The model retrieves answers based on the ingested files, making it useful for research, legal document analysis, or academic reading.
  - **Tools Used**: LangChain, OpenAI, Unstructured for PDF processing.

- **Equity Research Tool**:
  - **Description**: This tool processes financial articles related to equity research. Users can ask questions regarding stocks, market trends, or specific companies, and the model will retrieve and analyze the relevant data.
  - **Tools Used**: OpenAI API, SerpAPI for gathering articles, LangChain.

### Completed Projects

1. **Food Menu Name Generator**:

   - **Description**: Select a cuisine type, and the tool generates a restaurant name and a corresponding menu, showcasing creative text generation using AI.
   - **Tools Used**: OpenAI API, LangChain, Streamlit for web UI.

2. **Mini LLM Model with URLs**:

   - **Description**: Users provide a list of URLs, and the system scrapes content from them. The user can then ask questions about the topics the URLs cover. This demonstrates the use of web scraping and natural language understanding.
   - **Tools Used**: OpenAI API, LangChain, SerpAPI for URL content extraction.

3. **Question and Answer (QA) Project**:

   - **Description**: A simple system that allows users to ask questions based on provided context. Ideal for studying or training models on specific data.
   - **Tools Used**: OpenAI API for question generation and response formulation.

4. **Database Query Tool (SQL Questioning System)**:

   - **Description**: This tool uses Google Palm and LangChainâ€™s SQLDatabase integration to allow users to ask questions about a database. It converts questions into SQL queries, executes them, and returns relevant information from the database.
   - **Features**:
     - Short-term training on misinterpreted queries.
     - Embedding-based query similarity selector using HuggingFace models.
     - Embeddings stored in **Chroma DB** for efficient retrieval.
     - **Tools Used**: Google Palm, SQLDatabaseChain, HuggingFace Embeddings, Chroma DB.

   ```python
   from langchain.prompts import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
   from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
   from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

   embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Implement retrieval-augmented pipelines to enhance contextual understanding in QA tools.
- **Embeddings from Diverse Sources**: Experiment with embedding models like **OpenAI Embeddings** and **Cohere** to optimize search accuracy.
- **User Interface Improvements**: Further develop the front-end for better user experience, potentially moving beyond **Streamlit** to more advanced frameworks like **React**.
- **Integration of Multimodal Models**: Extend current projects to include text, image, and video inputs.
